- Text Preprocessing and Structuring is performed for all accident reports for the years 2017 -  2013. 
- The reports data is modified to include a new field - **Degre** which determines if an accident resulted in a fatality or hospitalization. It can be useful as a dependent/target variable to classify reports. 
- Environment file `tm_oil.yml` is updated and file structure is slightly modified, please update your local repo as well as your local environment to make changes. 
- A html file of the source code jupyter notebook is placed for easy viewing.
